# VLS2D
VLS2D is a 2D light creation system for use with the Unity game engine!

I have decided to push VLS2D to GitHub due to a personal schedule issues and not being able to commit 100% of my time to improving the product.
I expect to return to the open source project very soon but for now I look forward to seeing what type of improvements this wonderful community makes!

I want to thank everyone who have stood behind me and supported me this far and I hope you will understand this decision!

<b><i>There are currently a few bugs in this package that might but they should be cleared up soon</i></b>

There will be more information as I get the time to post it.
