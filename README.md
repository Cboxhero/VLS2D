# VLS2D
VLS2D is a 2D light creation system for use with the <b>Unity game engine</b>!

I have decided to push VLS2D to GitHub due to a personal schedule issues and not being able to commit 100% of my time to improving the product.
I expect to return to the open source project very soon but for now I look forward to seeing what type of improvements this wonderful community makes!

I want to thank everyone who have stood behind me and supported me this far and I hope you will understand this decision!

<b><i>Please keep in mind that this version is currently buggy as it is an alpha project. If you discover a bug or what you might think is a bug and do not see it on the list please add it to the bugs list. If you feel you can solve the bug, by all means please give it a shot! Otherwise, I or someone else will get to it as soon as we can.</i></b>

There will be more information as I get the time to post it.
